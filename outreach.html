            <p style="text-align: center;">Based on our primary research, we were able to address as many issues as we possibly could to create a solution using technology: Making learning as addictive as SOCIAL MEDIA! Hence, we developed WorkMate and FlexFit.</p>
            <h3 style="text-align: center; color: #f1c40f;">WorkMate</h3>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Workmate is an app created to be the means for highschool students to achieve the goal of being completely in balance and mentally positive regarding their work. It aims to do three things: Set Goals, Track, Achieve.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center;">FlexFit is an application based on two specific difficulties of highschool students: "I do not feel like working out when I should" and "I do not have the time to work out" in the most meticulous and gamified manner we could come up with.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center;">We hosted a webinar with expert parent coach and career counsellor ru.pathfinder to spread awareness in the ninth grade batch of students who were just about to enter into what could either be a very stressful and overwhelming period of their lives, or one that is exciting and filled with new accomplishments. Following are a few snaps from the webinar and the interactive game we played after.</p>
