        <!-- Nilay Kanakia -->
        <article class="interview">
            <h3>Nilay Kanakia (IIT Bombay)</h3>
            <p><span class="question">1. What challenges did you face during JEE preparation?</span><br>
            IIIT JEE prep is usually done during the 11th and 12th grades, wherein as per Nilay, students undergo standardized testing at coaching centres every week, with bad results causing harsh punishment. This, as per him, led to severe anxiety, social isolation, and a complete loss of self-confidence in those around him. He says that as a result of this, at IIT Bombay he sees many young students with grey hair, and a lack of physical well-being...</p>

            <p><span class="question">2. What advice do you have for managing stress during exam prep?</span><br>
            Nilay shared that extracurricular activities can make a significant difference when done without performance pressure. During a particularly low point in his preparation in 2023, he decided to make a painting...</p>

            <p><span class="question">3. How does social media impact JEE preparation?</span><br>
            Surprisingly, Nilay was of the opinion that social media could be used as a productivity-boosting tool. He said that his few minutes of social media allowed him to stay connected with the outside world...</p>

        <!-- Avi Desai -->
        <article class="interview">
            <h3>Avi Desai (UK)</h3>
            <p><span class="question">1. Do you face pressure during examinations in school, if yes, then what is the root cause of this (peer pressure, performance pressure, parents expectations, etc)?</span><br>
            Not really, stressing doesn’t achieve anything why even bother. You’re gonna do worse if you stress. If you’ve completely messed up and you know you’ll flunk, just wake up early and cram. If you’ve revised well you have nothing to stress about...</p>
            
            <p><span class="question">2. What are some measures taken in your school or country that allow you to combat stress that you face in your day-to-day life?</span><br>
            Not really me, but our school has some place for overwhelmed students to go (its like board games and that stuff, its run by older students). And we have good options for sport, and walks in the woods...</p>

            <p><span class="question">3. What are some personal measures you take (or wish to take in the future) to better manage your workload and hence allow yourself mental peace?</span><br>
            Stop doing work last minute, you do much better work when you’re not under pressure and it’d free up more time to relax after school instead of working into the night.</p>

            <p><span class="question">2. What are some measures taken in your school or country that allow you to combat stress that you face in your day-to-day life?</span><br>
            We have many support groups at school, and all our teachers are willing to help us anytime of the day which helps.</p>

            <p><span class="question">3. What are some personal measures you take (or wish to take in the future) to better manage your workload and hence allow yourself mental peace?</span><br>
            I really manage my time wisely and make sure I am prepared for all my tests and quizzes by doing my homework so I don’t have to stress much.</p>
